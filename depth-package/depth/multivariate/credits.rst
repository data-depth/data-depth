The :math:`\texttt{data-depth}` project started as an initiative to consolidate efficient implementations of data depth methodology in autumn 2012, with its first release in February 2013 as an R-package :math:`\texttt{ddalpha}`, including codes of Pavlo Mozharovskyi, Rainer Dyckerhoff, and Oleksii Pokotylo. Continuous development led to gradual improvement of the package throughout the recent decade and since early 2022 the work on the Python library 'data-depth' started, which includes part of the codes of the 'ddalpha' package as well as being augmented by new codes.

The project is currently being led Pavlo Mozharovskyi: https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/mozharovskyi/
